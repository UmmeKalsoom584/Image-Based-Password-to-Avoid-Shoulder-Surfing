🔐**Overview**:

An AI-powered secure authentication system that uses visual cryptography and machine learning to prevent shoulder surfing attacks. This innovative approach replaces traditional text passwords with image-based authentication combined with visual cryptography for enhanced security.

🚀 **Key Features**

Visual Cryptography: Splits authentication images into two shares that must be combined for authentication

AI-Generated Image Grids: Creates complex, unique authentication patterns using deep learning

Machine Learning Anomaly Detection: Identifies suspicious authentication attempts using Isolation Forests

Shoulder Surfing Protection: Visual cryptography ensures observers cannot steal credentials by watching

Customizable Security Levels: Adjustable complexity for different security requirements

🛡️ **Security Advantages**

Resistant to observation attacks: Shoulder surfers cannot obtain usable credentials

Two-factor authentication: Requires both knowledge (password) and possession (share image)

Behavioral analysis: ML algorithms detect unusual authentication patterns

Dynamic image generation: Unique authentication images for each session

🧠 **Technology Stack**

Python with TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning

OpenCV for image processing

Scikit-learn for machine learning and anomaly detection

PIL/Pillow for image generation and manipulation

Visual Cryptography for secure image splitting

📋 **How It Works**

Registration: Users create an account and receive an AI-generated authentication image

Share Generation: The system creates two visual cryptography shares

Password Setup: Users select specific cells on the image as their password

Authentication: Users must provide both their password and the correct share image

Anomaly Detection: ML algorithms monitor authentication patterns for suspicious activity

🎯 **Use Cases**

High-security environments where shoulder surfing is a concern

Public kiosks and shared computing facilities

Mobile authentication in crowded spaces

Financial institutions requiring enhanced security

Privacy-conscious applications where observation resistance is critical
